# style-matching

Feel free to modify this readme.

How it currently works:
- An anchor image is displayed in the top-left corner (for testing purposes).
- Select it and one other image that it is most similar to in style.
- Press 'reveal similarity' to highlight what the AI found to be most similar (highest similarity score in the HTML and .json file).

Suggestions:
- Please test to see if it is a fun or engaging activity. Scrapping it early and trying something else would be better than working on an activity that isn't engaging.
- I don't know JavaScript. This was vibe-coded until it 'worked'. The code will need checking.
- Give it a more stylised UI: title, background, buttons, etc.
- Display the images in a standardised size.
- Redo the selection highlight: currently extends outside some images, try other highlighting methods.
- Test it on a tablet.
